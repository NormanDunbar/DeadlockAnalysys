= Deadlock Analysis - Change Log

_Latest updates at the top of this file._


== Version 0.1.3
Another enhancement release.

* When multiple deadlocks exists in a trace file, it's nice to see what caused them all in the `Tracefile Summary` section of the report.


== Version 0.1.2
Slight enhancement release.

* Documentation added.
* Scanning within deadlocks stops at  the end of the current deadlock.
* The dumped session's SID is listed in the `Deadlock Summary` section in the report.


== Version 0.1.1
* Fixed bug whereby if there was a single deadlock in the trace file, the contents area of the report was blank.


== Version 0.1.0
* Initial release. _Everything_ is working perfectly, because it _always_ does, doesn't it?
